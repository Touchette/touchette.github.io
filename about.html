	<div class="about-me">
	    <p style="color:white" width="50" height="50">I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Oregon. I am passionate learning foreign language, alt-fashion (especially J-Fashion), illustration, and Japanese aestheticism. I love to indulge in lolita fashion for fun and if I want to play a video game I particularly enjoy Super Smash Bros: Melee. I am thinking about learning to speedrun Celeste as well as learning to illustrate. <br><br> I am currently working at Pipeworks studios as a software engineer; I have done work on <a href="https://www.adventureacademy.com/">Adventure Academy</a>, a children's MMO made for assisting in learning key topics like math and literature, as well as a yet unannounced collectible card game set to release some time in 2020. <br><br> Programmatically, I love low-level languages such as assembly language (I like NASM especially) as well as C (and C++ for bigger, more involved projects); I also love to think about how game engines and graphical engines work. Mathematically, I am fond of discrete mathematics like graph theory and number theory. I am currently studying Icelandic as my fifth foreign language.</p>
