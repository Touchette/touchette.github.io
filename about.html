	<div class="about-me">
	    <p style="color:white" width="50" height="50">I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Oregon. I am passionate about learning foreign language, alt-fashion (especially J-Fashion), illustration, and low-level programming. I love to indulge in lolita fashion for fun and am deeply interested in computer security & reverse engineering. I am thinking about learning to speedrun Celeste as well as learning to illustrate. <br><br> I have experience working at Pipeworks Studios as a software engineer; I have done work on <a href="https://www.adventureacademy.com/">Adventure Academy</a>, a children's MMO made for assisting in learning key topics like math and literature, as well as <a href="https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Valor%27s_Reach_(mobile_game)">Valor's Reach</a>, a Magic: The Gathering collectible card game published by Wizards of the Coast. <br><br> Programmatically, I love low-level languages such as assembly language (I like NASM and x86 especially) as well as C and C++; I also love to think about how game engines and their security works. Mathematically, I am fond of discrete mathematics like graph theory and number theory. I am currently studying Icelandic as my fifth foreign language.</p>
