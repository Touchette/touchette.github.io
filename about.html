	<div class="about-me">
	    <p style="color:white" width="50" height="50">Hello, my name is Touchette. I'm a student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Oregon, set to graduate with the class of 2020. I am passionate learning foreign language, alt-fashion, math, and computer science. I also love to play video games for fun and particularly enjoy World of Warcraft and Path of Exile. Looking to get into speedrunning and writing more personal code-based projects. <br><br> In terms of programming, I love low-level languages such as assembly language and including C (maybe C++ depending on your point of reference), and love to think about how game engines and graphical engines work. Mathematically, I am fond of discrete mathematics like graph theory and number theory. I am currently studying Icelandic as my fourth foreign language.</p>
